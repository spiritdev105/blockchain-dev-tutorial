# Overview

Let’s take a simple project built in Solidity and go through the process of building the same project on Solana.

## Solidity Project

A common first project you run into is a voting project.
The Solidity smart contract would look like this:

- Code

```
pragma solidity ^0.6.4;

contract Voting {
    mapping (bytes32 => uint256) public votesReceived;
    bytes32[] public candidateList;

    constructor(bytes32[] memory candidateNames) public {
        candidateList = candidateNames;
    }

    function voteForCandidate(bytes32 candidate) public {
        require(validCandidate(candidate));
        votesReceived[candidate] += 1;
    }

    function totalVotesFor(bytes32 candidate) view public returns (uint256) {
        require(validCandidate(candidate));
        return votesReceived[candidate];
    }

    function validCandidate(bytes32 candidate) view public returns (bool) {
        for(uint i = 0; i < candidateList.length; i++) {
            if (candidateList[i] == candidate) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Solana Development

`View` functions and `mapping` need to be done differently on Solana.

```
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("6voY4gV7kzuGr4hE2xjZnkdagFGNhEe8WonZ8UtdPWig");

#[program]
pub mod voting {
    use super::*;

    pub fn init_candidate(ctx: Context<InitializeCandidate>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn vote_for_candidate(ctx: Context<VoteCandidate>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InitializeCandidate{}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct VoteCandidate{}
```

We have two functions in our voting program, `init_candidate` and `vote_for_candidate`.
The `init_candidate` function maps directly to constructor in the Solidity smart contract, while `vote_for_candidate` maps one-to-one with `voteForCandidate` in Solidity.

One problem with `init_candidate` is that it can be called by anyone permissionless, unlike the contructor in Solidity only being called by the contract deployer. To solve this, we will employ a similar feature to `onlyOwner` from Solidity. We set a specific address on the Solana program that is the only one that can execute the instruction.

Let’s say our publicKey is `8os8PKYmeVjU1mmwHZZNTEv5hpBXi5VvEKGzykduZAik`. By adding a reference to this publicKey in the Solana program and requiring the signer to match, we effectively emulate both onlyOwner and the constructor.

```
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("6voY4gV7kzuGr4hE2xjZnkdagFGNhEe8WonZ8UtdPWig");

const OWNER: &str = "8os8PKYmeVjU1mmwHZZNTEv5hpBXi5VvEKGzykduZAik";

#[program]
pub mod voting {
    use super::*;

    #[access_control(check(&ctx))]
    pub fn init_candidate(ctx: Context<InitializeCandidate>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn vote_for_candidate(ctx: Context<VoteCandidate>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InitializeCandidate<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct VoteCandidate {}

fn check(ctx: &Context<InitializeCandidate>) -> Result<()> {
    // Check if signer === owner
    require_keys_eq!(
        ctx.accounts.payer.key(),
        OWNER.parse::<Pubkey>().unwrap(),
        OnlyOwnerError::NotOwner
    );
    Ok(())
}

#[error_code]
pub enum OnlyOwnerError {
    #[msg("Only owner can call this function!")]
    NotOwner,
}
```

We added an access control function check that will check if the signer of `init_candidate` matches the address listed in the smart contract. If the signer does not match, the `OnlyOwnerError` will be thrown, and the transaction will fail.

Let’s move on to the next bit in the Solidity smart contract, `candidateList` and `votesReceived`. While you can use a Vec in a Solana program similar to bytes32[], managing the payments for changing the size can be a bit of a hassle. Instead, we will utilize Program Derived Addresses given specific candidate name, with the value found at that address being the `votesReceived` by the candidate.

To use Program Derived Accounts in a Solana Program, you use `seeds` and `bump` in the account. First, let’s create the account to track `votesReceived`.

```
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Candidate {
    pub votes_received: u8,
}
```

`#[account]` denotes the struct as a Solana account, while the `#[derive(InitSpace)]` is a useful macro for auto-calculating the space required to allocate for Candidate. The `votes_received` can hold a count just like `votesReceived` in the Solidity smart contract.

Expanding the `InitializeCandidate` and `VoteCandidate`, we get the following:

```
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(_candidate_Name: String)]
pub struct InitializeCandidate<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init,
        space = 8 + Candidate::INIT_SPACE,
        payer = payer,
        seeds = [_candidate_Name.as_bytes().as_ref()],
        bump,
    )]

    pub candidate: Account<'info, Candidate>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(_candidate_Name: String)]
pub struct VoteCandidate<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [_candidate_Name.as_bytes().as_ref()],
        bump,
    )]

    pub candidate: Account<'info, Candidate>,
}
```

First you’ll notice `#[instruction(_candidate_Name: String)]`. This means the context for `InitializeCandidate` expects a string `_candidate_name` to be passed into the instruction. We can see later this is later used in seeds = [_candidate_name.as_bytes().as_ref()]. This means that the seed of the PDA will be `_candidate_Name`, and the value stored at the PDA will be the candidate’s votes_received.

Next you may have some questions on `space = 8 + Candidate::INIT_SPACE`. The `Candidate::INIT_SPACE` is how big the `Candidate` account is + 8, 8 being the bytes added at the beginning of Anchor framework accounts for security checks. `pub system_program: Program<'info, System>`, is required when you’re creating an account, which is denoted by init. This means that any time an instruction using the `InitializeCandidate` context is called, the instruction will try to create a candidate account.

Now let’s add the business logic found in voteForCandidate from the Solidity smart contract.

```
pub fn vote_for_candidate(ctx: Context<VoteCandidate>, _candidate_name: String) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.accounts.candidate.votes_received += 1;
    Ok(())
}
```

Here we take an additional parameter discussed earlier, `_candidate_name`. This will help match to the exact account we’re referencing for the candidate. We then increment the votes by 1 for that candidate.

That’s all we need to complete on the Solana program side, with the final Solana program looking like this:

```
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("6voY4gV7kzuGr4hE2xjZnkdagFGNhEe8WonZ8UtdPWig");

const OWNER: &str = "8os8PKYmeVjU1mmwHZZNTEv5hpBXi5VvEKGzykduZAik";

#[program]
pub mod voting {
    use super::*;

    #[access_control(check(&ctx))]
    pub fn init_candidate(ctx: Context<InitializeCandidate>, _candidate_name: String) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())

    }

    pub fn vote_for_candidate(ctx: Context<VoteCandidate>, _candidate_name: String) -> Result<()> {
        ctx.accounts.candidate.votes_received += 1;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(_candidate_name: String)]
pub struct InitializeCandidate<'info> {

    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init,
        space = 8 + Candidate::INIT_SPACE,
        payer = payer,
        seeds = [_candidate_name.as_bytes().as_ref()],
        bump,
    )]
    pub candidate: Account<'info, Candidate>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(_candidate_name: String)]
pub struct VoteCandidate<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [_candidate_name.as_bytes().as_ref()],
        bump,
    )]
    pub candidate: Account<'info, Candidate>,
}

#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Candidate {
    pub votes_received: u8,
}

fn check(ctx: &Context<InitializeCandidate>) -> Result<()> {
    // Check if signer === owner
    require_keys_eq!(
        ctx.accounts.payer.key(),
        OWNER.parse::<Pubkey>().unwrap(),
        OnlyOwnerError::NotOwner
    );

    Ok(())
}

#[error_code]
pub enum OnlyOwnerError {
    #[msg("Only owner can call this function!")]
    NotOwner,
}
```

`validCandidate` is already accounted for because `vote_for_candidate` will fail if you pass an account that does not exist.
`totalVotesFor` can be done client-side with Typescript and does not need to exist within the Solana program.
