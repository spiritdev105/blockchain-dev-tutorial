# [Ethereum](/1.%20Ethereum/)

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain that supports smart contracts. Ethereum's flexibility and widespread adoption make it the ideal choice for building a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps).

# [Solana](/2.%20Solana/)

Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its fast transaction processing speeds and low fees. It is quickly gaining popularity for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Solana uses the programming language Rust for writing its smart contracts, known as programs.
