# Overview

Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) are a concept from Solana but can be adapted to other blockchain protocols. PDAs are addresses derived from a seed value and a program ID, making them predictable and deterministic.

# How PDAs Work:

- Seed Value: A base value used to derive the address.
- Program ID: A unique identifier for the program (smart contract) generating the address.
- Deterministic: The same seed and program ID will always generate the same PDA.

PDAs are particularly useful for creating addresses that need to interact with specific smart contracts, ensuring that funds or data sent to these addresses are automatically handled by the designated program.
