# Mapping

Mapping does not exist on Solana. Instead, you use program-derived addresses(PDA).

## Example Code

1. Solidity

```
mapping(address => uint) public balances;

```

2. Solana

- Client

```
    const [BALANCE_PDA] = await anchor.web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
        [Buffer.from("BALANCE), pg.wallet.publicKey.toBuffer()],
        pg.program.programId
    );
```

- Program

```
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(restaurant: String)]
pub struct BalanceAccounts<`info> {
    #[account(
        init_if_needed,
        payer = signer,
        space = 500,
        seeds = [balance.as_bytes().as_ref(), signer.key().as_ref()],
        bump
    )]
    pub balance: Account<'info,BalanceAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
pub struct BalanceAccount {
    pub balance: u8
}
```

# Upgradable

In Solidity, we use proxy to make smart contracts as upgradble.
On Solana, programs are default upgradable without any special work involved

Each smart contract can be upgraded by a CLI command `solana program deploy <program_filepath>`.

While programs are default upgradable, you can still demote their status to immutable with `solana program set-upgrade-authority <program_address> --final`.
Once immutable, the program will be flagged as not upgradable on the explorers

# msg.sender or tx.origin

There isn ºt an equivalent for `msg.sender` or `tx.origin` on Solana because each transaction can have multiple signers.
Also the person sending the transaction is not necessarily the one who signed the transaction because you have someone else pay for your transactions.
