# How does a transaction function work in Ethereum?

transactions alter state of EVM and updated state is being broadcasted by node to the entire network.
miners initiate the transaction and propagate the change in state to all the other nodes.
transaction fees (gas) are paid to miners so that transactions would be mined and become valid.

- A transaction hash gets cryptographically generated after tx is submitted
- The transaction is broadcast out to the network in a pool of numerous other transactions.
- A miner selects the transaction and includes it in the next block to verify the transaction and declare it “successful.”
- The transaction receives “confirmations.” Each confirmation equals one new block created since the block that the transaction was a part of. The more confirmations, the more certain it is that the transaction will be properly processed by the network.
- Sometimes recent blocks can get re-organized, which can make it appear as though the transaction wasn’t successful. But the transaction could just wind up being included in a different block. The likelihood of this happening decreases with each confirmation.
