# What are the primary layers of blockchain technology?

Blockchain consists of `five` layers: `hardware infrastructure`, `data`, `network`, `consensus`, and `application layers`. These layers handle functions from `data storage to user-facing applications`.

# What are the key differences between blockchain layers 0, 1, 2, and 3?

1. `Layer 0` includes foundational elements like hardware and protocols.
2. `Layer 1` maintains dispute resolution, consensus mechanisms, and blockchain programming (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
3. `Layer 2` offers better scaling capabilities and third-party integration.
4. `Layer 3` hosts decentralized applications (dApps) and user-facing applications.ss
