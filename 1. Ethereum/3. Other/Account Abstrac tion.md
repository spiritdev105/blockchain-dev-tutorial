# Overview

`Account Abstraction` is a concept that aims to enhance the user experience in blockchain systems by making accounts more flexible and programmable.

In traditional blockchain systems, there are two types of accounts:

- Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs): Controlled by private keys, typically belonging to users.
- Contract Accounts: Controlled by code, typically smart contracts.

`Account Abstraction` blurs the lines between these two types by allowing the logic that determines the validity of a transaction to be embedded within the account itself, not just in the blockchain protocol.

# Key Features of Account Abstraction

- Customizable Transaction Logic: Users can define custom logic for transaction validation, such as multi-signature requirements or rate limiting.
- Improved Security: By embedding security checks directly in the account, users can prevent certain types of attacks.
- User Experience: Enables features like meta-transactions, where a third party can pay for gas fees on behalf of the user.
